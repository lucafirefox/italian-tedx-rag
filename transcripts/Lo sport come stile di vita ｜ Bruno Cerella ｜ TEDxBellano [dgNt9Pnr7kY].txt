ollen Good evening, it's a great honor to be here. I start from the title, saying, sport as a lifestyle, to leave a reflection point for each one of us. I was born in Argentina. My father was son of my non-italian, after the war I was emigrated to Argentina. By my mother, I had my nonna francese married with a Spanish-speaking man. At the age of 13, my non-italian is coming to the Italian citizen for my birthday, and he gave me the gift. I told him, give me those 100 euro that you leave every year, which for me will be more fun. He told me, that you will be a great tool for your life. I didn't have told you the message of the nono. But, back to the beginning, I started playing balla-canestro at four years old. Today I have 38 years old. So I have been 34 years old with the balla in hand. A life. I was 18 years old, I was a procurator, I called for playing balla-canestro in Italy. But it had to be an experience of life through sport. Because I came to Italy with 250 euro per month, a bike and a house, to live an experience far away from home, to be responsible for learning a language, to know the Italian culture and so I started playing balla-canestro and so I started this adventure in 2004. It led me to play from the lowest levels of the balla-canestro to the lowest levels of the European level with Olympia-Milano and the Reier-Venezia which are the two teams with which I have enjoyed the most. I have won, I have known many parts of the world, I have made amicizia and I have lived a wonderful life through sport. At the age of 25 years old I was in the mood to do something beneficial through sport. I think that we as athletes have a social responsibility that goes beyond a canetron, beyond a trophy that one gets when wins a competition. That social responsibility has led me to develop a project with my best friend Tommaso Marino that brings the balla-canestro to various parts of the world using it as a life tool, as a life tool, as a life tool. The sport has given me a lot of life, given me an opportunity, given me the opportunity to be here in front of you and to have chosen Italy as a country where I live. I live now that I've stopped playing and I've been a pensioner and I've been a pensioner for two weeks. In 2011 it was our first trip. We arrived in the capital of Kenya we played in the country we played in the city in various barackpages trying to know a culture trying to understand how they live the sport of young people trying to bring a contribution to the community more necessary but at the same time bringing us home an experience of life indimaginable. After these 15 days in the city of Nairobi we told us that we have to make sure that this experience of life becomes a project that uses the sport as an educational tool as an educational tool that is not only aiming to build campers but we could have 100 camps for the world just to make a piece of cement and two boxes and it's done we use the sport as an educational tool we have included putting us in the pang of the youth who live in these barackpages of 250.000 300.000 abitanti that have the same possibilities of us to have the possibility of choosing what sport to do to have the possibility of the people who take care of these boys from the point of view sportive so what we have created are the real basketball academies that are the management of the trainers and the physical space to do sport a way to to help the school with the sport a way to help a child to get out of school and not to be in the criminal to prostitution to drugs but to do what we have done we to enter in a playground to be trained to be trained by teachers that educate us and promote the values for life through passion this was our ability to play basketball to bring fun to love to this ball so from 2011 to today we have developed a project that is solid and we have to make it sustainable in the time and we are present in four continents because from Kenya we have to go to Zambia where we have two other basketball academies from there we have decided to go to Argentina where I was born and I was born and I was happy to bring a project to my land a few years later we started to develop the project in Cambodia in the capital Phnom Penh where I am now starting next week and finally during the Covid we decided to make projects in the Italian territory we have created projects in the Italian territory we have created projects in the Italian territory we have created projects in the Italian territory part of the urbanization of a camp in the city where we do our own activities so it is not the camp it is the project that involves the school that involves the community and the people who can also touch with the hands we slam dunk who are the people who carry on the project for the world we can't say that our vision is to to to to to to this cultural is more simple to build a bridge and to to to to to to if you go to our academy you play with other people that we never have seen before because the language is universal and the language is universal and the rules is not the graph of the field we built in the flag of the the basketball academy is the way to live with a field for us the sport is the game that is sustainable in time the community has not a sponsor and to make a sport sport to have impact social and to be sustainable in time we need support economic and we are able to create support thanks to 200.000 people who don't have to who use the other method is to create a community that is part of the what is pre now sport the ball can is part of my life is something that I have 25 years when I have done my life and I have done what I I have a moment with my heart and I have a love that is a big one of the two of the the the the the the the the the the
