 Give it to me like I love you So, every year, in the world, over 400 million tons of plastic. But this number is equal to 1,000 hospital 3 Grand dormirlasseations trying to put it in the world In Europe, the 40% of the plastic generated is destined to produce plastic plastic in use, often in useful ways. Like these. These. These. And also these. But, unfortunately, the problem is not only the plastic plastic. But, the consumption of natural resources is to create an umbrella and a non-useable product. Because the production of any umbrella and any product needs to be very precious resources such as water, water, water, water, trees. And any product, before or after, becomes a waste to manage. And to manage a waste, it will be necessary to use new natural resources to collect, transport and recycle it. When we talk about the management of the waste, we know that we can and we have to do to collect different resources. And also, the resources have been told that the institutions have said to work, to school, to family. And so that many of you are doing it. And so that you can feel a sense of frustration mixed with impotence and anger in making this daily gesture. A little bit about the lack of others that maybe not make it. And a little bit about it because so many people they all mix together. And so, they all mix together. I know very well this frustration. I've tried it for many years. But it was just this frustration that has generated in me the desire of a change. I wanted to find a solution that went to the root of the problem of the waste waste. I wanted to find a radical solution. And it's just because of this frustration that I discovered two worlds. The world of the diffuse products that are sold out of weight or weight in the weight in reusable products. And the world of the zero waste literally in Italian zero refiuti. That's what they have been designed and designed to be a lot through the eco design to have a lower impact along the entire life of a product. From the production to the transport to the consumption to the smelt. Good evening. I'm Ottavia Belli and I'm the founder of the map of the Fuse & Zero Waste and today I'm here to show you that your small actions can make a difference. They can make a difference for the environment, for the whole society local and distante. And they can make a difference for your portfolio. And in showing you that your small actions make a difference I will show you that it is possible to reduce your waste in a simple way. Today we produce much more waste than those we can recycle. As you can see from this graph that describes the production pro-capite of a European of their own waste about the half the half of the waste of the waste and composted but the half of the half of the waste of the waste and put in waste in waste. Even though this overproduction of our waste we are forced to export them to abroad legally and illegally from Malaysia to Thailand to Turkey to Switzerland to Germany with an important economic, social and environmental cost also because our waste are not always being sent to us in countries that have the technologies and the democracies necessary to manage them correctly. And not only as we have seen from the graph as we have seen a lot of waste in the graph that most of our waste are encended and sent in a lot of waste with an important impact on the environment and on our health. Various scientifics are analyzing the impact of some materials on our health and on our health. These are all you know all of these are plastic or microplastic and these are invisible to human are found in our human are in our blood and these are found in the maternal in the placenta of the children in the vegetables in the water in the water in the sea and the sea and the sea in the sea is estimated that we have used to a credit card annually and some of you would have thought well we will have a material so pure natural and ecologico purtroppo the solution is not so simple but complex such as the natural and we have to respond with complex solutions to the products that are not just changing material to define sustainable because it is not only the production and the consumption of plastic to have an impact ambiental and on our health of the recent scientific they are analyzing the impact of the material that are going to replace the plastic on our health and we are talking about paper bioplastics and bamboo and they have been found inside these materials are toxic and these toxic are damaging our fertility causing damage to our DNA causing cancer and many other other irreversible Now you are wondering if I single human being what can I do? I can I can a single molecule of a system composed of 8 billion of molecules and to differentiate by material hoping to be recycled the key word is prevention we can prevent the production of our our and prevent the consumption of two things are too expensive to be used for using products and prevent the insand health that are now emerging to prevent the prevent prevent from prevent is much easier and we will show you some small examples that you can put in practice for example we can pass from this type of that you know that you know that you know that you can see this could look like but they are not are made made and made radically different this is destined to three months and after three months it will be offered indifferential because it will be in a a a a a a second the the we the this a the the the the own this without ten a pen with the one that one the our and about this our our took by our curtir the pigment from a variety of two different ones are not perfect funcioning影 Pedal or, we can pass from using these made up of mono-bl squash or we can use this medical condition They are used once and then put into the indifferential. Every month. And therefore, these products will end in a discharge or in an inceneratory. This, instead, can durate up to 10 years. It allows a annual savings between 150 and 200 absorbents. It is a savings from 120 and 150 euro per year. Or, we can pass from pre-mallation to a pre-mallation. A pre-mallation. A pre-mallation. A pre-mallation. A pre-mallation. A pre-mallation. A pre-mallation. And considering that every Italian consume about 23 kg of pasta per year. We are about to prevent a few meters of pre-mallation. Or, we can pass from a pre-mallation to a pre-mallation. Or, we can buy from a pre-mallation to a pre-mallation. Or, we can buy from a pre-mallation to a pre-mallation. This brick is a pre-mallation to a pre-mallation. We can buy from a pre-mallation to a pre-mallation. This brick is made by a material called PoliAccoppiato. They're three materials, alluminio, carta e plastic. They make this product difficult to be recycled. And when it doesn't have recycled, they will be sent to a charge or a generator. This, in fact, is the product. The time of realization is 3 minutes. The difficulty is extremely low. The cost is between 4 and 5 times lower. In fact, a family of 4 people can spend every year 200€ and about 100 of these bricks are probably not recyclable. Finally, the last product has to do with them. They gave us a terrible primate. We are between the first and the second position worldwide for the consumption of water in bottles. Although in most countries have a high quality of water, we can replace it with this. This is a filter for the rubinetto that allows a family of 4 people to spend annually 1.500 bottles in plastic. And about 800€ in base to the brand that is used. I know that you think that the small small daily actions don't make a difference. I understand. But you must think that the waves are not made by one single big one that spins, but by many small small ones that unite them to spin in the same direction. And the same goes for our individual actions. We are going to be able to get a difference by one after the other, one after the other, one after the other, one after the other, one after the other, one after the other. And they also go to the other people that are working on their daily lives. And they will be able to get a difference in the same way. And they will be able to get a difference in the same way. And they are laughing to go to them". They are looking in net bleeding about analysis. I would love define at least, some of them contractors entering life to get away and returns to reduce reducing climate change and producing Before I leave you, I want to share with you a poem that I really hearted and that follows me from the first day of my journey. It is like this. I am only one, but I am still one. I cannot do everything, but I can do something. And the fact that I cannot do everything will stop me from doing that little I can do. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
