 Paul peach some hoard the Whole My Good evening everyone. Today we will face a virtual journey to discover ourselves and others, not through images, but through listening to the voice. And so I ask you to wear the masks that you have been given for for a greater immersion in this journey. I want to invite you to look at the appearance, explore the complexity of the world that we are around and understand that the journey of the discovery of ourselves and the reality doesn't know ever a definitive end. Who, like me, live in a condition of visual disability is used to train other senses to compensate the 80% of information that they come through images. Paradossalmente, the cecità invites us to listen to with attention everything that we are around, encouraging us to not lose to know what is around us even without the sight. However, this evening I will not talk about my cecità neither of the Italian Italian Ciechi and the people who I belong nor of their services and their activities in favor of of the young people with disabilities with visual disabilities and not even of how these services and these activities can make the cecità and the impoverished even even protagonists in their lives and society. But I will talk about a common thread that unizes ciechi and the people and that is always to all of us. We all have this common thread we have already known when we do a telephone to a one and we give them a character and a fision only listening to their voice. Or when we affirm that a person has a a person who likes and who likes and who is certainly to be to to hear the voice and then we have a little bit more of this art that is incredibly powerful art of listening the voice and we and we and we and we hear what we hear the voice that the voice of the voice that transmits the emotion and even the personality and through the influences the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the can really to this experience in po the the the the the the the If your voice is alive, vibrant, if you tell her delusions, your voice becomes more slow, more pesant. And now you feel the emotion of talking in public, directly from my voice. But the listening of the voice, it is not only about understanding the others, but also about communication. When we learn to modulate our voice in a way, we can transmit more clear and authentic messages. We can make the others feel that we are really interested in them, that their experience is really important for us. These exercises are not only in relationships, but also in relationships and professional relationships. How could you improve the communication between colleagues, students and teachers, and people of work, if they were able to remove the emotions of the others? Even a child knows the emotions of the adult, not only what they say, but how they say it. And how an adult could feel more valued and considered if we were able to take the emotion of the soul, and how an adult can influence the emotions of the person. And now, for a moment, we take into consideration the environment and how this can influence our voice. We will hear the sound of a voice. We will hear the sound of a step, but we will hear how, in different circumstances, this can contribute to change emotions. We are together. Our first protagonist is just a step back to home after a busy day and frenetic day and happy to be at home. The computer has not been twisted with the heart seguro as well andamic words. And when it comes back, the person has engineered to laugh with a emotional был. Very complicated moment to laugh, seventies, and early to reopen the desk open again. When his heart is in deep distance breaks'd, because he hears... Hey, who is it? I don't like these jokes. Is there someone? And now we are together with a young man on his first anniversary of his night. He's just been back home and he's just been back to his mother and he's just been back to his wife because he's going to finish his job and then he's going to pass on his cousin. A little contrariate, he's left his gift for her to her table and he's left on the porch. Let's listen to his thoughts. It's our first anniversary. The first anniversary! And he's already forgotten. And then what's the time of the day to go to Sissy? What's the only way she hears? When she hears... so realtors our next friend who is attending the exit of a delicate intervention of a person very very dear. He is sitting on a chair in his hand with a very sharp journal, let and let. He is taking the glasses, he is closing the journal, and he is holding the head on the chair. He is closing his eyes and begins to think about the moment he is passing together with this person, with his smile, with his smile, with his smile fragorously contagious. When he hears... Dottoressa, dottoressa, is everything going well? He will soon be able to continue his work? And here we are, with an employee who is finishing the compilation of a participation to a bando in scadenza. They have referred to that probably there will be a proroga. When he receives a message, no one has a proroga. You can hear the impression of him in a position. To the elementaliyday Pvd by accused Moses. the room. I'm going to hear the tone. I've received the message and surely your incursion in my office and your url will not will end up soon, but soon and soon. And now let's leave our friends with their emotions. I hope you have made me understand that listening to the voice is an amazing ability that enriches our lives and improves our relationships, in any way, in any way. The next time you will find in a conversation with someone, don't limit you to listen to the words, listen to the voice, listen to the emotions that are inside each syllable. I invite you to practice this attention and empathic, and empathic, because only so we can understand the mind and build the more strong and significant relationships. We can all learn to look at the world with new eyes, new eyes, pronti ad accogliere ogni sfumatura della vita, con gratitudine e curiosità. Perché ognuno di noi è unico e diverso, e in questa diversità stanno normalità e ricchezza umana, speciale e ogni giorno che accogliamo con un sorriso. Grazie. Grazie.
